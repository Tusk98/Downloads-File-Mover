Name of app: ??

Version formatting (vx.y.z.r)
x = major change (UI overhaul, new feature, new OS)
y = minor change (large group of bugfixes, enhanced feature)
z = bugfix release
r = dev stage designation (0 = alpha, 1 = beta, 2 = release-ready, 3 = final release ver)
	Every update of r will reset the release format (back to v1.0.0)

Downloads-File-Mover
Final idea:
A desktop app that aims to improve the browsing experience by automatically sorting downloads to destinations chosen by the user.

The final app will have the following features:
Selecting to save a file will skip the Save As popup and pass to the download step
An .exe application will bring the user to a menu to customize everything about the app
File type => destination (Call this a path)
List of selected file types
Default paths?
Toggles for settings (suppressing the save as popup)

======================================================================
Versions:
 
Initial repository (v1.0.0.0)
Includes an Executable Jar file that allows the user to select .mp3, .pdf, and .doc/.docx file type(s) to move
Successfully identifies .mp3, .pdf, and .doc/.docx files
Creates a new folder at /Desktop/File_Mover and moves the selected file type(s) into the folder





======================================================================

Design:

Designing from front -> back:
	Taking in user input will be very important.
The frontend app will consist of the following:
Popup when you first open the app that explains what it does
Add Paths sequence:
Prompt for the user to select one (or more) file types
¡°What types of files should be moved?¡±
Search bar + autofill + dropdown list of file types
Prompt for the user to select destination
¡°Where should this/these file(s) be moved?¡±
Browse button to find a path
End screen
¡°Add more¡± option
Goes back to 1.
¡°Finished¡± option 
Takes all of the user¡¯s selected paths and adds them to the program 
View paths:
Users are able to search through a list of their custom file types with paths (.mp3s to /user/Music, .pdf to /user/Documents/school_notes)
The file types in the list will be selectable and clicking it will open/display the path destination.


======================================================================

Features to Consider for the Future:

Categorizing files by keyword/string in filename
Ex: .mp4 files with the string ¡°Game-of-Thrones¡± can be moved to a different folder than other .mp4 files
Categorizing files by the site you download from
Doable if we can scrape ¡°downloaded from¡± data from files
Compare strings? If .pdf is downloaded from a site that includes ¡°http://uwaterloo.ca¡±, move it to a different folder than other .pdf files
The above method would allow for user defined specificity 
I.e.
Could be as broad as: any .mp4 from kissanime is saved to ../Anime
Or as specific as: any .pdf from (professor¡¯s assignment hosting site) is saved to ../Assignments
